## MySql and UUIDs

- avoid using raw uuid as PK or as an indexed column. They are usually stored in `VARCHAR(36)` and consume 146 bytes. They are random and cause clustered index to be rebalanced
they are included in each secondary indexes (consuming disk and memory)
- instead use `BINARY(16)` datatype and use `UUID_TO_BIN(uuid(), 1)` to generate the sequential ids.
- Don't use uuid v4. With UUID v4m itâ€™s not possible to generate any sequential ouput and this is why those random UUID should never be used as Primary Key with InnoDB.
